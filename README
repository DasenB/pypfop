Python Preprocessor of the Formating Objects Processor [pypfop]
===============================================================

Preprocessor to the `Apache FOP`_..

How does it works?
------------------
It does what the huge title is implying, preprocess a *higher* level template
to generate *dynamically* an specifoc `XSL-FO`_. document, which then gets 
feeded to `Apache FOP`_. to generate the expected output. So that means that
this packages *requires Java*  ``>_<'``, but fear not my python comrade it is
almost transparent to the python application.

In general the internal workflow is::

    template ->  mako -> apply css ->  xsl-fo ->  fop -> *Document*

Installation
------------

1. Install pypfop::

    pip install pypfop

2. Install `Apache FOP`_.:

   #. Download the binary package of fop1.1 either the  zip_. or tar_. package.
   #. Decompress in wherever place you like and set environment variable ``FOP_CMD``
      to the ``bin/fop`` of the decompressed folder. [1]_.


Usage
-----

About XSL-FO syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As you should notice already it is required to now how to format xsl-fo documents
which in most part are very similar to the HTML counterparts, the best reference
that I could find online is in the `XML Bible`_.


Why!
----

This project it use to be part of a larger project of one of my customers, 
which I decide early on that I will use *only python 3*, terrible decision 
if you want to generate pdf files easily or at least at the moment.
I was looking to have some kind of *template* to the very rigid format of
the average invoice and billing order, so pypfop came to relieve that pain.
